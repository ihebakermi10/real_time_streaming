Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing several Python libraries, including Tweepy (for Twitter API interaction), TextBlob (for sentiment analysis), Matplotlib (for data visualization), NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation), and regular expressions (for text cleaning).

TwitterClient Class: This class is responsible for handling Twitter API authentication and provides methods to retrieve tweets, user timelines, friend lists, and home timeline tweets. It initializes with a Twitter user's screen name (optional).

TwitterAuthenticator Class: This class handles Twitter API authentication by using OAuthHandler and sets access tokens.

TwitterStreamer Class: This class is designed for streaming and processing live tweets based on specified hashtags. It initializes with the TwitterAuthenticator class and provides a method to stream tweets.

TwitterListener Class: This class inherits from Tweepy's Stream class and defines methods to handle received data and errors during the streaming process. It writes the received data to a file specified by fetched_tweets_filename.

TweetAnalyzer Class: This class contains functions to clean tweets, analyze their sentiment using TextBlob, and convert a list of tweets into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Main Block: In the main block, an instance of the TwitterClient and TweetAnalyzer classes is created. It then retrieves the most recent 200 tweets from the Twitter user with the screen name "realDonaldTrump" (you can change this to any other user). The sentiment of these tweets is analyzed and added to the DataFrame. Finally, the first 100 rows of the DataFrame are printed.
